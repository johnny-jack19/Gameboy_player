The index page is a landing page that branches out into different games.
The games are a work in progress with Pokemon being the only one semi-working.

The media queries are at 768px and 1200px.

The css requirements are:
1. Using flexbox (index page) or grid (gameboy page)
2. Create an animation, the sprites are animations

The javascript requirements are:
1. Show/hide one or more content areas or elements on your site through clicking a button
2. The entire pokemon game is made with vanilla javascript and should also meet the requirements (but it isn't finished yet)
