The index page is a landing page that branches out into different games.
The games are a work in progress with Pokemon being the only one semi-working.
The ? blocks display game info and the running sprites are links to the game (Pokemon is the only one currently working).
The game pictures have an overlay over them for text readability.
The landing pages include: index.html, index.css, and index.js

The media queries are at 768px and 1200px.
1. At 768px, the game cards turn into a gallery style and the overlay/text is on hover only.
2. At 1200px, the hero image is dropped and the game cards are layed out in a side scroller sytle.

The css requirements are:
1. Using flexbox (index page) or grid (gameboy page)
2. Create an animation, the sprites are animations

The javascript requirements are:
1. Show/hide one or more content areas or elements on your site through clicking a button
2. The entire pokemon game is made with vanilla javascript and should also meet the requirements (but it isn't finished yet)
