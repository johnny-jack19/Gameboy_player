                    One day the kingdom of the peaceful mushroom people was invaded by the Koopa, a tribe of turtles famous for their black magic. 
                    The quiet, peace-loving Mushroom People were turned into mere stones, bricks and even field horse-hair plants, and the Mushroom Kingdom fell into ruin.

                    On a tiny star somewhere far, far away from earth, there is a very special place known as Dream Land. 
                    The Dream Landers are very happy people who use their magical Sparkling Stars to play and work among the heavens.

                    In the year 2000 of the history of the cosmos, representatives from the many different 
                    planets in the galaxy established a congress called the Galactic Federation, and an age 
                    of prosperity began. A successful exchange of cultures and civilization resulted, and 
                    thousands of interstellar spaceships ferried back and forth between planets. But space 
                    pirates also appeared to attack the spaceships.

                <p class="game-text-2 hidden">
                    The Federation Bureau created the Galactic Federation Police, but the pirates' attacks 
                    were powerful and it was not easy to catch them in the vastness of space. The Federation 
                    Bureau and the Federation Police called together warriors known for their great courage 
                    and sent them to do battle with the pirates. These great warriors were called 
                    "space hunters." They received large rewards when they captured pirates, and made 
                    their living as space bounty hunters.

                    It is now year 20X5 of the history of the cosmos, and something terrible has happened. 
                    Space pirates have attacked a deep-space research spaceship and seized a capsule 
                    containing an unknown life-form that had just been discovered on Planet SR388. This 
                    life-form is in a state of suspended animation, but can be reactivated and will 
                    multiply when exposed to beta rays for 24 hours. It is suspected that the entire 
                    civilization of Planet SR388 was destroyed by some unknown person or thing, and there 
                    is a strong possibility that the life-form just discovered was the cause of the 
                    planet's destruction. To carelessly let it multiply would be extremely dangerous.
